<h1> About me</h1>

I am a simple programmer/artist/critic who is aspiring to make his own games at some point in his life.
To achieve this and hone my skills, I offer to make modules for Unity games, small websites and other applications for a small fee.
Due to my schedule I'm usually pretty busy, even on my days off I tend to sleep in because of my job.
Because of this, replies to requests and other contact may take a day or two to actually happen.
